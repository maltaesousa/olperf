The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\r\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\r\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\r\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\r\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\r\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\r\n *\r\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\r\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\r\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\r\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\r\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\r\n * would return the new center.\r\n *\r\n * You can add your own observable properties with\r\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\r\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\r\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\r\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\r\n *\r\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\r\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\r\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\r\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\r\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\r\n *\r\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

To use this, you must first create\r\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\r\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}. You can then add the forward and inverse\r\n * functions with {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. See\r\n * examples/wms-custom-proj for an example of this.\r\n *\r\n * Note that if no transforms are needed and you only need to define the\r\n * projection, just add a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} with\r\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}. See examples/wms-no-proj for an example of\r\n * this.\r\n */\r\nimport { getDistance } from './sphere.js';\r\nimport { applyTransform } from './extent.js';\r\nimport { modulo } from './math.js';\r\nimport { toEPSG4326, fromEPSG4326, PROJECTIONS as EPSG3857_PROJECTIONS } from './proj/epsg3857.js';\r\nimport { PROJECTIONS as EPSG4326_PROJECTIONS } from './proj/epsg4326.js';\r\nimport Projection from './proj/Projection.js';\r\nimport Units, { METERS_PER_UNIT } from './proj/Units.js';\r\nimport * as projections from './proj/projections.js';\r\nimport { add as addTransformFunc, clear as clearTransformFuncs, get as getTransformFunc } from './proj/transforms.js';\r\n/**\r\n * A projection as {@link module:ol/proj/Projection}, SRS identifier\r\n * string or undefined.\r\n * @typedef {Projection|string|undefined} ProjectionLike\r\n * @api\r\n */\r\n/**\r\n * A transform function accepts an array of input coordinate values, an optional\r\n * output array, and an optional dimension (default should be 2).

The projection determines the\r\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\r\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\r\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\r\n *\r\n * ### The view states\r\n *\r\n * An View is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,\r\n * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\r\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\r\n *\r\n * The `zoom` state is actually not saved on the view: all computations\r\n * internally use the `resolution` state. Still, the `setZoom` and `getZoom`\r\n * methods are available, as well as `getResolutionForZoom` and\r\n * `getZoomForResolution` to switch from one system to the other.\r\n *\r\n * ### The constraints\r\n *\r\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\r\n * states of the view, but any constraint defined in the constructor will\r\n * be applied along the way.\r\n *\r\n * A View object can have a *resolution constraint*, a *rotation constraint*\r\n * and a *center constraint*.\r\n *\r\n * The *resolution constraint* typically restricts min/max values and\r\n * snaps to specific resolutions. It is determined by the following\r\n * options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`, `maxZoom` and `zoomFactor`.\r\n * If `resolutions` is set, the other three options are ignored. See\r\n * documentation for each option for more information. By default, the view\r\n * only has a min/max restriction and allow intermediary zoom levels when\r\n * pinch-zooming for example.\r\n *\r\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\r\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\r\n * By default rotation is allowed and its value is snapped to zero when approaching the\r\n * horizontal.\r\n *\r\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\r\n * default the view center is not constrained at all.\r\n *\r\n * ### Changing the view state\r\n *\r\n * It is important to note that `setZoom`, `setResolution`, `setCenter` and\r\n * `setRotation` are subject to the above mentioned constraints. As such, it\r\n * may sometimes not be possible to know in advance the resulting state of the\r\n * View. For example, calling `setResolution(10)` does not guarantee that\r\n * `getResolution()` will return `10`.\r\n *\r\n * A consequence of this is that, when applying a delta on the view state, one\r\n * should use `adjustCenter`, `adjustRotation`, `adjustZoom` and `adjustResolution`\r\n * rather than the corresponding setters. This will let view do its internal\r\n * computations. Besides, the `adjust*` methods also take an `opt_anchor`\r\n * argument which allows specifying an origin for the transformation.\r\n *\r\n * ### Interacting with the view\r\n *\r\n * View constraints are usually only applied when the view is *at rest*, meaning that\r\n * no interaction or animation is ongoing. As such, if the user puts the view in a\r\n * state that is not equivalent to a constrained one (e.g. rotating the view when\r\n * the snap angle is 0), an animation will be triggered at the interaction end to\r\n * put back the view to a stable state;\r\n *\r\n * @api\r\n */\r\nvar View = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(View, _super);\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\r\n     */\r\n    function View(opt_options) {\r\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\r\n        var options = assign({}, opt_options);\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {Array<number>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.hints_ = [0, 0];\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {Array<Array<Animation>>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.animations_ = [];\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {number|undefined}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.updateAnimationKey_;\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @const\r\n         * @type {import(\"./proj/Projection.js\").default}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {import(\"./coordinate.js\").Coordinate|undefined}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.targetCenter_ = null;\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {number|undefined}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.targetResolution_;\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {number|undefined}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.targetRotation_;\r\n        _this.applyOptions_(options);\r\n        return _this;\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * Set up the view with the given options.\r\n     * @param {ViewOptions} options View options.\r\n     */\r\n    View.prototype.applyOptions_ = function (options) {\r\n        /**\r\n         * @type {Object<string, *>}\r\n         */\r\n        var properties = {};\r\n        var resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {number}\r\n         */\r\n        this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {number}\r\n         */\r\n        this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {number}\r\n         */\r\n        this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\r\n         */\r\n        this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {number}\r\n         */\r\n        this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\r\n        var centerConstraint = createCenterConstraint(options);\r\n        var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\r\n        var rotationConstraint = createRotationConstraint(options);\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {Constraints}\r\n         */\r\n        this.constraints_ = {\r\n            center: centerConstraint,\r\n            resolution: resolutionConstraint,\r\n            rotation: rotationConstraint\r\n        };\r\n        this.setRotation(options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0);\r\n        this.setCenter(options.center !== undefined ? options.center : null);\r\n        if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\r\n            this.setResolution(options.resolution);\r\n        }\r\n        else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\r\n            this.setZoom(options.zoom);\r\n        }\r\n        this.resolveConstraints(0);\r\n        this.setProperties(properties);\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {ViewOptions}\r\n         */\r\n        this.options_ = options;\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

Uniforms are common, read-only values that\r\n *   can be changed at every frame and can be of type float, arrays of float or images.\r\n *\r\n *   Shaders must be compiled and assembled into a program like so:\r\n *   ```js\r\n *   // here we simply create two shaders and assemble them in a program which is then used\r\n *   // for subsequent rendering calls\r\n *   const vertexShader = new WebGLVertex(VERTEX_SHADER);\r\n *   const fragmentShader = new WebGLFragment(FRAGMENT_SHADER);\r\n *   this.program = this.context.getProgram(fragmentShader, vertexShader);\r\n *   this.context.useProgram(this.program);\r\n *   ```\r\n *\r\n *   Uniforms are defined using the `uniforms` option and can either be explicit values or callbacks taking the frame state as argument.\r\n *   You can also change their value along the way like so:\r\n *   ```js\r\n *   this.context.setUniformFloatValue('u_value', valueAsNumber);\r\n *   ```\r\n *\r\n * ### Defining post processing passes\r\n *\r\n *   *Post processing* describes the act of rendering primitives to a texture, and then rendering this texture to the final canvas\r\n *   while applying special effects in screen space.\r\n *   Typical uses are: blurring, color manipulation, depth of field, filtering...\r\n *\r\n *   The `WebGLHelper` class offers the possibility to define post processes at creation time using the `postProcesses` option.\r\n *   A post process step accepts the following options:\r\n *\r\n *   * `fragmentShader` and `vertexShader`: text literals in GLSL language that will be compiled and used in the post processing step.\r\n *   * `uniforms`: uniforms can be defined for the post processing steps just like for the main render.\r\n *   * `scaleRatio`: allows using an intermediate texture smaller or higher than the final canvas in the post processing step.\r\n *     This is typically used in blur steps to reduce the performance overhead by using an already downsampled texture as input.\r\n *\r\n *   The {@link module:ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass~WebGLPostProcessingPass} class is used internally, refer to its documentation for more info.\r\n *\r\n * ### Binding WebGL buffers and flushing data into them\r\n *\r\n *   Data that must be passed to the GPU has to be transferred using {@link module:ol/webgl/Buffer~WebGLArrayBuffer} objects.\r\n *   A buffer has to be created only once, but must be bound every time the buffer content will be used for rendering.\r\n *   This is done using {@link bindBuffer}.\r\n *   When the buffer's array content has changed, the new data has to be flushed to the GPU memory; this is done using\r\n *   {@link flushBufferData}. Note: this operation is expensive and should be done as infrequently as possible.\r\n *\r\n *   When binding an array buffer, a `target` parameter must be given: it should be either {@link module:ol/webgl.ARRAY_BUFFER}\r\n *   (if the buffer contains vertices data) or {@link module:ol/webgl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER} (if the buffer contains indices data).\r\n *\r\n *   Examples below:\r\n *   ```js\r\n *   // at initialization phase\r\n *   this.verticesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\r\n *   this.indicesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\r\n *\r\n *   // when array values have changed\r\n *   this.context.flushBufferData(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\r\n *   this.context.flushBufferData(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\r\n *\r\n *   // at rendering phase\r\n *   this.context.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\r\n *   this.context.bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\r\n *   ```\r\n *\r\n * ### Specifying attributes\r\n *\r\n *   The GPU only receives the data as arrays of numbers. These numbers must be handled differently depending on what it describes (position, texture coordinate...).\r\n *   Attributes are used to specify these uses. Use {@link enableAttributeArray} and either\r\n *   the default attribute names in {@link module:ol/webgl/Helper.DefaultAttrib} or custom ones.\r\n *\r\n *   Please note that you will have to specify the type and offset of the attributes in the data array. You can refer to the documentation of [WebGLRenderingContext.vertexAttribPointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttribPointer) for more explanation.\r\n *   ```js\r\n *   // here we indicate that the data array has the following structure:\r\n *   // [posX, posY, offsetX, offsetY, texCoordU, texCoordV, posX, posY, ...]\r\n *   let bytesPerFloat = Float32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT;\r\n *   this.context.enableAttributeArray(DefaultAttrib.POSITION, 2, FLOAT, bytesPerFloat * 6, 0);\r\n *   this.context.enableAttributeArray(DefaultAttrib.OFFSETS, 2, FLOAT, bytesPerFloat * 6, bytesPerFloat * 2);\r\n *   this.context.enableAttributeArray(DefaultAttrib.TEX_COORD, 2, FLOAT, bytesPerFloat * 6, bytesPerFloat * 4);\r\n *   ```\r\n *\r\n * ### Rendering primitives\r\n *\r\n *   Once all the steps above have been achieved, rendering primitives to the screen is done using {@link prepareDraw}, {@link drawElements} and {@link finalizeDraw}.\r\n *   ```js\r\n *   // frame preparation step\r\n *   this.context.prepareDraw(frameState);\r\n *\r\n *   // call this for every data array that has to be rendered on screen\r\n *   this.context.drawElements(0, this.indicesBuffer.getArray().length);\r\n *\r\n *   // finalize the rendering by applying post processes\r\n *   this.context.finalizeDraw(frameState);\r\n *   ```\r\n *\r\n * For an example usage of this class, refer to {@link module:ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer~WebGLPointsLayerRenderer}.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @api\r\n */\r\nvar WebGLHelper = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(WebGLHelper, _super);\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param {Options=} opt_options Options.\r\n     */\r\n    function WebGLHelper(opt_options) {\r\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\r\n        var options = opt_options || {};\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {HTMLCanvasElement}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.canvas_ = document.createElement('canvas');\r\n        _this.canvas_.style.position = 'absolute';\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {WebGLRenderingContext}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.gl_ = getContext(_this.canvas_);\r\n        var gl = _this.getGL();\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {!Object<string, BufferCacheEntry>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.bufferCache_ = {};\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {!Array<WebGLShader>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.shaderCache_ = [];\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {!Array<WebGLProgram>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.programCache_ = [];\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {WebGLProgram}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.currentProgram_ = null;\r\n        /**\r\n         * @type {boolean}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.hasOESElementIndexUint = includes(WEBGL_EXTENSIONS, 'OES_element_index_uint');\r\n        // use the OES_element_index_uint extension if available\r\n        if (_this.hasOESElementIndexUint) {\r\n            gl.getExtension('OES_element_index_uint');\r\n        }\r\n        listen(_this.canvas_, ContextEventType.LOST, _this.handleWebGLContextLost, _this);\r\n        listen(_this.canvas_, ContextEventType.RESTORED, _this.handleWebGLContextRestored, _this);\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.offsetRotateMatrix_ = createTransform();\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.offsetScaleMatrix_ = createTransform();\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {Array<number>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.tmpMat4_ = create();\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {Object.<string, WebGLUniformLocation>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.uniformLocations_ = {};\r\n        /**\r\n         * @private\r\n         * @type {Object.<string, number>}\r\n         */\r\n        _this.attribLocations_ = {};\r\n        /**\r\n         * Holds info about custom uniforms used in the post processing pass.\r\n         * If the uniform is a texture, the WebGL Texture object will be stored here.\r\n         * @type {Array<UniformInternalDescription>}\r\n         * @private\r\n         */\r\n        _this.uniforms_ = [];\r\n        if (options.uniforms) {\r\n            for (var name_1 in options.uniforms) {\r\n                _this.uniforms_.push({\r\n                    name: name_1,\r\n                    value: options.uniforms[name_1]\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        /**\r\n         * An array of PostProcessingPass objects is kept in this variable, built from the steps provided in the\r\n         * options.

To change the\r\n * extent to the first quadrant (the default for OpenLayers 2) set the extent\r\n * as `[0, 0, width, height]`.\r\n * @property {number} [transition] Duration of the opacity transition for rendering.\r\n * To disable the opacity transition, pass `transition: 0`.\r\n * @property {number} [tileSize=256] Tile size. Same tile size is used for all zoom levels.\r\n * @property {number} [zDirection] Indicate which resolution should be used\r\n * by a renderer if the views resolution does not match any resolution of the tile source.\r\n * If 0, the nearest resolution will be used.
